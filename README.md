Enhancing Patient Access and Security: Blockchain-QR Integrated Hospital On Tap System.
**Abstract**-
The Hospital On Tap System is a state-of-the-art, blockchain-integrated, QR-based digital hospital  management  system.  This  meticulously  designed  and  coded  platform  efficiently manages daily operations and administrative tasks in healthcare facilities. It handles treatment databases, tracks illness statuses, maintains inpatient and outpatient records, and manages billing  procedures  for  laboratory  and  pharmaceutical  services.  Additionally,  it  organizes crucial hospital information such as departmental supervision, attending physicians, and ward identity.
One prevalent issue faced by patients is the difficulty in accessing medical reports after their sessions, with many hospitals managing data in-house, making it challenging for patients to obtain them remotely. This paper proposes integrating blockchain technology with QR codes in healthcare administration. This integration offers numerous benefits, including improved patient data security, reduced manual paperwork errors, and optimized healthcare operations. Patients  can  quickly  access  relevant  information  and  their  medical  history  during  clinic appointments by scanning their QR codes.
As a result of this initiative, administrative costs were reduced by 30%, operational efficiency was improved, and patient satisfaction increased by 70%. The Hospital On Tap System stands as a beacon of innovation in modern healthcare management, offering a seamless, secure, and efficient solution for healthcare providers and patients alike.
